      <h2 class="services-title">Puzzle Design with Purpose</h2>
      <p class="services-text-1">
        At Match3LO, we create smart, engaging puzzle levels that balance fun,
        difficulty, and monetization. Whether you're building your first Match-3
        game or updating a live title, we deliver content that keeps players
        coming back.
      </p>
      <p class="services-text-2">
        Our process blends design intuition with player data — so each level
        feels good to play and performs well. From early-game onboarding to
        monetization pacing, we help you build levels that truly work.
      </p>
      <p class="services-text-3">
        We work closely with dev teams to match your game’s tone, mechanics, and
        progression goals. Every level pack is built with intention — ready to
        plug in and playtest.
